# Voltage Divider Module

*Short Story:*
  I wanted to quickly calculate the extremes of voltage divider output for arbitrary parameters.

*Long Story:*
  This was written long before I learned to use version control. Hence the Clojure file mess. I first wrote the voltage divider in Python and a few weeks after learned rudiments of Clojure and rewrote the voltage divider in the latter. I believe the Python version is unfinished, don't remember though. The Clojure version is probably finished. It's certainly more developed, evidenced by inclusion of an E series of resistor values (i.e. standardized values).
